            <img src="about.jpg" alt="Founder at his first store location.">
            <p>Young Lee, who had recently graduated from UCLA with a degree in economics, had joined the workforce and often found himself on the road. However, he discovered that restaurants serving healthy meals were few and far between. Entrepreneurial in nature, in 1995 he opened the first restaurant in Orange County that served simple, healthy fast food. What better way to solve a problem than to solve it yourself? Word about the healthy food and quick service at Fire Bowl spread, and Young quickly became extremely busy. He developed a very broad customer base. The widely loved concept appealed to many different people. Mr. Lee began to give back by feeding the homeless, and soon began to sponsor children in need. He is committed to sponsoring 2 children per location that opens. Today, through Fire Bowl Inc., Mr. Lee sponsors a staggering 338 children. Words continued to spread, and the founder saw franchising as a way to provide even more people with a healthy alternative to fast food while mainÂ­taining the high level of service. And so the story continues today with 180 Fire Bowl Restaurants in California, Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Oklahoma.</p>
