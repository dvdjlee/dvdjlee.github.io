					<p>    In 2018, Lloyd Drexler had a vision for a cafe that would unite the three things he loves the most; food, art, and people. Growing up, going to his local cafe was his favorite part of week as he would go with his family habitually, every Sunday morning. "The smell of breakfast, comforting interior, and the sound of hustling and bustling of everyone in the cafe was my sanctuary."  </p>
